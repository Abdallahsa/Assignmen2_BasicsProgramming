Who wins the vote?
The Egyptian Sewing Syndicate is holding an election to see who will be the next president. There are three 
candidates Adham, Bilal, and Catherine. Due to controversy during the last elections it has been decided 
that this year they will try to implement a new voting system next to the old one to see if the results would 
be different.
Normally in elections only one candidate is given a vote per voter; however, this year in addition to the 
normal election calculation a point system is to be tried. This means that each voter should give a list of all 
three candidates in order of preference.
The point system dictates that for each first preference a candidate receives they will be given 3 points, 
second preference 2 points, and third preference 1 point. The winner of the election will be the candidate 
with the most votes.
Write a program that first prompts the user to enter names of 3 candidates , & the number of voters in the 
election. The user should then enter the names of the candidates in order of preference for each voter. The 
program should then have two calculations: one for the result of the normal majority election and one for 
the result of the new point system
